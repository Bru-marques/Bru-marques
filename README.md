- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Bru-marques


I am an enthusiastic Web Developer with a passion for creating bespoke software systems. I wold like to join a team of talented developers who work tirelessly to deliver top quality software applications for their clients.

I like to reinvent myself and learn new things. I found my passion in web development an I believe that my experiences and professional maturity can contribute to teamwork.


I've being learning how to develop solutions in the shape of software using my creativity and my studies in JavaScript / TypeScript by building web applications with React that are not only beautiful, but are enjoyable to use and really problem-solvers.
